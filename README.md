# Flutter Learning Project

## Description

This Flutter project is my first deep dive into mobile application development, inspired by the mobile version of [No Me Pierdo Ni Una](https://www.nomepierdoniuna.net/). Designed as a hands-on learning project, it showcases the integration of various technologies and architectural patterns to build a robust and scalable application. 

Key features and technologies include:

- **Supabase for Data Management**: Utilizes Supabase for real-time data handling, providing a seamless backend service for storing and retrieving application data.
- **Firebase for Notifications**: Integrates Firebase to enable the reliable delivery of push notifications, enhancing user engagement and retention.
- **Bloc for State Management**: Implements the Bloc pattern for efficient state management, facilitating predictable state management and simplifying the handling of user interactions.
- **Get_it + Injectable for Dependency Injection**: Takes advantage of Get_it and Injectable for dependency injection, promoting a modular and decoupled architecture.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows Clean Architecture principles to structure the app, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and ease of testing, illustrated by `clean.png`.

## Screenshots
